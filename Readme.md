# FastAI course 
> By : Jeremy Howard

### this are the notes, notebooks and questionnares answers from the course offered by Jermy Howard, I'll also upadate the notes while reading `deep learning for coders with Fastai and PyTorch`


# progress 
- [ ] How to train models that achieve state-of-the-art results in
     * Computer vision, including image classification (e.g., classifying pet photos by
        breed) and image localization and detection (e.g., finding the animals in an
        image)

     * Natural language processing (NLP), including document classification
            (e.g., movie review sentiment analysis) and language modeling
- [ ]  Tabular data (e.g., sales prediction) with categorical data, continuous data, and
        mixed data, including time series
        Collaborative filtering (e.g., movie recommendation)
- [ ] How to turn your models into web applications
- [ ] Why and how deep learning models work, and how to use that knowledge to
        improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of your models
- [ ] The latest deep learning techniques that really matter in practice
- [ ] How to read a deep learning research paper
- [ ] How to implement deep learning algorithms from scratch
- [ ] How to think about the ethical implications of your work, to help ensure that
        you’re making the world a better place and that your work isn’t misused for harm
